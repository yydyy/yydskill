# Changelog

## v0.6 - 2026-06-04

- Added `Mao Zedong Perspective` rule set based on the analytical and strategic frameworks distilled from the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.
- Added full, `mini`, and `nano` releases for `mao-zedong-perspective`, plus workbench traceability and a canonical workbench `full.md` symlink.
- Updated the README release matrix and Books List.

## v0.5 - 2026-05-04

Commit: [`01d1fab`](https://github.com/ciembor/agent-rules-books/commit/01d1fab)

- Added compatibility check in `_rule-workbench/CHECK_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## v0.4 - 2026-05-03

Commit: [`63cbe8c`](https://github.com/ciembor/agent-rules-books/commit/63cbe8c)

- Added a new `Refactoring.Guru` rule set based on the public Refactoring.Guru refactoring process, code smell catalog, and refactoring technique catalog.
- Added full, `mini`, and `nano` releases for `refactoring-guru`, plus workbench traceability and a canonical workbench `full.md` symlink.
- Standardized all released and workbench rule headings to the `# OBEY {name} by {author}` format, omitting `by` when no clear author exists.
- Removed `Mini`, `Nano`, and `Traceability` suffixes from rule-file H1 headings while keeping version context in filenames and body structure.
- Updated the README release matrix metrics after the heading changes and added `Refactoring.Guru` to the Books section.
- Updated `_rule-workbench/PROCESS.md` so future compression runs preserve the standardized heading format.
